    Dear Researcher,
</p>

<p>
    We apologize that the server was down recently due to some issues in ECUST.
</p>

<p>
    Now the server is working. Please visit
    <a href="http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2">http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2</a>
    to access admetSAR2. 
</p>

<p>
    We've created a <a href="https://zealseeker.github.io/admetsar2-doc/">Github Page</a>
    that shows the current status of the server.
    When you cannot access admetSAR, you may visit this site to check whether
    it is due to (99% of cases) IT issue or other reasons
    (such as maintaining or debugging).
    You can also subscribe when the server is down again so that we will notify you when the server recovers.

</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions about admetSAR, please contact the current maintainer, 
    <a href="mailto://490579089@qq.com">Chaofeng Lou</a> or our supervisor,
    Prof. Yun Tang (<a href="mailto://ytang234@ecust.edu.cn">ytang234@ecust.edu.cn</a>)
</p>

<p>
    Thank you for using admetSAR in your study. 
</p>

<p>
Best regards, </br>
admetSAR team
