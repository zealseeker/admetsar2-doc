## Introduction


## Predict ADMET properties

### Basic prediction

- **Input**  
The query molecule should be represented as [SMILES](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html).
For example, *figure 1* shows the SMILES of benzene. The user can also draw the structure of the query molecule by click "Draw molecule", and a structure editor will shown (*figure 2*). After the structure is drawn, click "save" and the SMILES of the molecule will automatically display in the inputbox.

- **Predict**  
After the molecule is correctly input, click "Predict" to submit the job (*figure 1*) and a successful message will display that provide the task id the url to get the result (*figure 3*). You don't need to manually click the link since the page will automatically turn to that page once the task is completed.
